## Recent Disclosures

### Universal Data Fabric (UDF)

[→ View UDF Repository](https://github.com/aRcHmaGe333/udf)

**A next-generation vision for distributed data & global infrastructure.**

Universal Data Fabric is a flagship architectural disclosure and coalition-building effort—an ambitious blueprint for content-addressed, deduplicated, and universally interoperable data, compute, and device abstraction.  
This work is public-interest driven and openly seeks funders, prospective collaborators, and foundational partners to help shape and realize this vision on a global scale.

- Designed to become global infrastructure—standards-grade, open, and responsibly stewarded.
- Seeking:  
    - Funding partners, organizational stewards, and technical visionaries.
    - Provisional core team members (described in repository) for future, post-funding activation.
    - Advisory and coalition participants for stewardship and design.
- Founder’s Role: My primary contribution has been defining and launching the vision. Going forward, I seek a guiding, strategic role—helping set direction and foster collaboration, while empowering true experts to build the next steps.

> *If you are interested in pilot partnerships, coalition-building, or being provisionally named for future technical or advisory roles, please see [FUNDING.md](https://github.com/aRcHmaGe333/udf/blob/main/FUNDING.md) or open an issue in the repository.*

### ECOmpile

[→ View ECOmpile Repository](https://github.com/aRcHmaGe333/ECOmpile)

**An “AI refinery” for building hybrid neural–code stacks from self-assessing neural systems (with a dose of human-in-the-loop oversight).**

ECOmpile is an R&D-phase project exploring how models can improvise, refine, and extract the best elements of automated workflows—then distill these into transparent, reproducible code artifacts.  
The vision:  
- Cost-effective, safety-conscious, and environmentally sustainable outcomes
- Traceable, inspectable pipelines for neural-symbolic code generation and auditing
- Emphasis on governance, risk, and genuine value—not marketing hype

See the repository’s layered documentation for executive overview, architecture, roadmap, and early SDK concept examples.
